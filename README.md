# Product Extraction from Shopping Website

This project uses Selenium to navigate a shopping website, switching between different search filters. The goal is to extract the products that appear in all searches performed, allowing efficient identification of the most relevant items.

## Features

- **Product Search**: Performs searches for specific terms, such as "laptop."
- **Product Extraction**: Extracts product names from result pages, considering different filters (no filters, lowest prices, top-rated).
- **Common Product Identification**: Identifies and saves the products that appear in all searches, enabling more effective analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Selenium**: Browser automation library used to interact with the shopping website.
- **WebDriver**: Tool for controlling the Chrome browser.
- **XPATH**: Used to locate elements in the page DOM.
